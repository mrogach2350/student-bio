    <p>I am an aspiring front-end web developer. I have a varied background, almost all of it not in the tech world. I finished a degree in English literature and French about eight years ago, and have since been working as an ELL teacher in Minneapolis and France. I also spend a lot of my time writing and reading. I play and make music too. I am hoping to find a whole new world to explore with newly obtained knowledge of coding.</p>
